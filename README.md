# Book Swap

My friends and I like to swap books a lot, but it can be hard to keep track of all the books everyone has available, this web app allows individuals to upload books they have available to swap to get in touch with others. 

No form of authentication - anyone can add or remove a book updated by anyone or list that any other person has a book - hopefully won't be an issue between friends.
